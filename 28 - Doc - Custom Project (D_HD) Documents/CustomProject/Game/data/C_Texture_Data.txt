# This file is used by the ComponentInstantiator and Subcomponent Loader objects.
# Everything outside of curly braces is disregarded. Therefore title's such as 'Player' can be 
# added for dev context.

# Each line is read and it's data passed to the appropriate component loader. Each of these loaders
# has the ability to format and read a line of component data. Example below:

#	Entity {
#		Transform | x, y, w, h ;
#		Origin | x, y ;
#		Texture | Sprite_name | x, y, w, h | render_this ;
#		Interactable;
#	}
