## Who Am I?

## Purpose
* This repository is for you and the teaching staff only. It should private and not be visible to the world.
* One of your first tasks is to provide staff with read-level access to your repository where this file is stored.
* The unit teaching staff account for bitbucket is gp.swin.repos@gmail.com
* Make sure that your account has your real name, and uses your swinburne email address. This allows us to find you and your work easily.
* We have provided a folder structure for the unit tasks. You don't have to use it, but we highly recommend that you do.

## Notes
A useful "README" file is considered a good practice for shared or world-visible repositories, so it makes sense to get into the
habit for this unit. However, please keep in mind that this repository should NOT be made visible to the world.
