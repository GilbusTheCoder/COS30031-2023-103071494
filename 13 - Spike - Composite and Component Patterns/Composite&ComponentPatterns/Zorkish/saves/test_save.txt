#	The Entity loading system works based on a set of tags in the format below.
#	Note that the args are specific to the flag (Inventory component will have different args to spatial component)
#	and are to be written in lowercase
#
#	Additionally, items should be instantiated first so they can be reference later as shown below.
#
#	This system could be updated such that only a tag and args for the components are required with the components 
#	required for each entity flag being known at compile time. However, this method was chosen for the sake of clarity.
#
#	Example:
#	EntityTag_0 : ComponentFlag_00(arg00, arg01), ComponentFlag_01(arg10, arg11), ..., ComponentFlag0n(argn0, argn1);
